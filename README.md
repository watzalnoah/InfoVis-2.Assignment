### Information on how to start the programm: 

Since it is a jupyter notebook you have to open your notebook and afterwards the programm there. We could not provide the dataset on my github so that you can just run the programm with the URL because the geodata was to big for uploading. So you have to download the data (house sales) and the geodata where I will provide the link here and save it on your device. Afterwards you have to adjust the path to read in the data sets. 
Link of geodata: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/zip-codes/explore?location=47.353134%2C-121.894226%2C8.50
